abstract: "Evaluating the cognitive capacities of large language models (LLMs) requires overcoming not only anthropomorphic but also anthropocentric biases. This article identifies two types of anthropocentric bias that have yet to receive sufficient critical attention in the context of LLM evaluation: overlooking how auxiliary factors can impede LLM performance despite competence (auxiliary oversight), and dismissing LLM mechanistic strategies that differ from those of humans as not genuinely competent (mechanistic chauvinism). Mitigating these biases necessitates an empirically-driven, iterative approach to mapping cognitive tasks to LLM-specific capacities and mechanisms, which can be done by supplementing carefully designed behavioral experiments with mechanistic studies."

title: "Anthropocentric bias in language model evaluation"

summary: "This paper identifies two overlooked forms of bias in LLM evaluation: auxiliary oversight (failing to account for factors that impede performance despite competence) and mechanistic chauvinism (dismissing non-human problem-solving strategies as illegitimate). We propose addressing these through empirically-driven approaches combining behavioral experiments with mechanistic analysis."
