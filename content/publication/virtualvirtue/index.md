abstract: "Virtual reality (VR) induces a radical psychological reorientation. Yet descriptions of this reorientation are often steeped in theoretically misleading metaphors. We offer a more measured account, grounded in both philosophy and cognitive psychology, and use it to assess the claim that VR promotes moral learning by simulating another's perspective. This hypothesis depends on the assumption that avatar use produces experiences sufficiently similar to those of others to enable empathic growth. We reject that assumption and offer two arguments against it: empathy relevant to moral learning requires interpretive effort and contextual understanding, not just a shift in perspective, and VR's open-ended, user-driven structure tends to reinforce prior assumptions rather than unsettle them. Still, avatar use may have a different effect on moral learning, which we call self-fragmentation."

title: "Merely virtual virtue? The empathy machine hypothesis and the promise of virtual reality"

summary: "We examine virtual reality's potential as a tool for moral learning and empathy development. While we reject the 'empathy machine hypothesis' that VR promotes empathy by simulating others' perspectives, we propose that avatar use may support moral learning through a different mechanism: self-fragmentation."
