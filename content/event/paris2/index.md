summary: "Scientific workflows can discipline generative AI to support reliable inference despite hallucination risks."
abstract: "Generative AI increasingly supports scientific inference, from protein structure prediction to weather forecasting. Yet its distinctive failure mode, hallucination, raises epistemic alarm bells. I argue that this problem can be addressed by shifting from data-centric to phenomenon-centric assessment of hallucinations. Through case studies of AlphaFold and GenCast, I show how scientific workflows discipline generative models through theory-guided training and confidence-based error screening. These strategies convert hallucination from an unmanageable epistemic threat into bounded risk. When embedded in such workflows, generative models support reliable inference despite opacity, provided they operate in theoretically mature domains."
